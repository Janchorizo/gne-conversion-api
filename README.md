### Graphviz Network Explorer _(GNE)_, simple user interface for interacting with svg output files from Graphviz.

> Graphviz is capable of creating highly detailed network diagrams that can turn complicated to
> read, interpret and, thus, getting insight from.

This project aims at leveraging the capabilities of modern data visualition to facilitate the task
of network exploration with a few key questions in mind:
- __What different nodes are there for each type of address range?__
- __Is there a trend in communication between nodes of different address range?__
- __Which are the different nodes that connect to a specific one and, how are ports involved?__

For this, GNE takes a Graphviz svg output file as input along with the graph xpath specification
needed to identify between nodes and links.
